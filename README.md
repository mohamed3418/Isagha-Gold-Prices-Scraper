# 🪙 Gold Prices Scraper

This project is a **Python web scraping script** that collects **real-time gold prices** from [Isagha.com](https://market.isagha.com/prices) and saves the extracted data to a **CSV file**.  
It captures gold price details such as **gauge (العيار)**, **buy price**, **sell price**, **currency**, and **price change information**.

## 📌 Features

- 🟡 Scrapes **gold gauge**, **buy/sell prices**, **currency**, and **price change status**.  
- 🌐 Uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to fetch and parse live data from Isagha Market.  
- 💾 Saves the extracted data into a **CSV file (`Gold_Prices.csv`)** encoded in UTF-8, preserving Arabic text.  
- 📝 Ideal for data analysis, reporting, or daily tracking of gold price changes.
